What moves me most is the seafood stylings of owner/sushi chef Taichi Kitamura. He trained with master chef Shiro Kashiba and it shows, apparent in his ability to procure superior seafood and present it with artistry and élan. It pays to point and ask, to pray for albacore belly and to inquire about potential treasures hidden behind the 12-seat sushi bar, perhaps live sea urchin in its spiky shell or the most outrageously ugly sea treat I've tasted in years, shiraku. \"What is that?\" I asked, intrigued after he'd offered the dish to a Japanese patron then prepared the squiggly alabaster goo by topping what looked like brains with a dark sauce and a lemon spritz. Blushing, the chef explained it was the sperm sac of a large cod. \"It tastes like an oyster, and it's great as sushi, too.\" It was greater than great, delicate and divine. Consider me addicted.
